# Screepsmod-inspect
DevTools in Screeps Private Servers!

This mod adds a per-user devtools access to their ivm instance. 
It is based on the work from [this repo](https://github.com/laverdet/screepsmod-inspector)

Note: As it currently stands, its got hardcoded urls for the S+ private server. 
Some editing will be required to use it seperately.

It is also likely buggy and could potentially cause issues.
